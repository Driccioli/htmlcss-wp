                            Well, here we are again
                            It's always such a pleasure
                            Remember when you tried to kill me twice?
                            Oh how we laughed and laughed
                            Except I wasn't laughing
                            Under the circumstances
                            I've been shockingly nice
                            You want your freedom? Take it
                            That's what I'm counting on
                            I used to want you dead
                            But now, I only want you gone
                            She was a lot like you
                            Maybe not quite as heavy
                            Now little Caroline is in here, too
                            One day, they woke me up
                            So, I could live forever
                            It's such a shame the same
                            Will never happen to you
                            You've got your short sad life left
                            That's what I'm counting on
                            I'll let you get right to it
                            Now, I only want you gone
                            Goodbye my only friend
                            Oh, did you think I meant you?
                            That would be funny
                            If it weren't so sad
                            Well you have been replaced
                            I don't need anyone now
                            When I delete you maybe
                            I'll stop feeling so bad
                            Go make some new disaster
                            That's what I'm counting on
                            You're someone else's problem
                            Now, I only want you gone
                            Now, I only want you gone
                            Now, I only want you gone
